Put all of your player characters into the PCs file in the following format:

[NAME]|[INITBONUS]|[ADVANTAGE]

[NAME] should be replaced with the character's name.

[INITBONUS] should be replaced with the character's initiative bonus.

[ADVANTAGE] should be replaced with "a" for advantage on initiative rolls, or a "d" for disadvantage on initiative rolls. Anything else to say this character has got no advantage or disadvantage.

Seperate each character on their own line like so:

[NAME]|[INITBONUS]|[ADVANTAGE]
[NAME]|[INITBONUS]|[ADVANTAGE]
[NAME]|[INITBONUS]|[ADVANTAGE]
