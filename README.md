# DnD-Combat-Helper
A simple combat helper meant to keep track of initiative order in DnD combat.

Define player characters in the PCs.txt file, giving their initiative modifier, and whether they have advantage, disadvantage, or nothing. From there, you can advance the initiative order, reset it, add NPCs or more PCs, and more. Note that the program cannot simulate full combat. It only helps keep track of notes on characters, health of NPCs, initiative order, and a few other things.
